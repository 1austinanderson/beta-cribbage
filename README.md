# beta-cribbage
Reinforcement learning program for Cribbage!

Python 3.4 - need to install at least Keras and h5py, maybe more.

Start in playThrowingCards to give it a whirl.

So far, the program manages to outperform me at choosing cards to throw to the crib.

It also knows how to compare options during the pegging phase, but needs further refinement.
