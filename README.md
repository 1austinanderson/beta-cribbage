# beta-cribbage
My reinforcement learning program for Cribbage! Written in Python 3.4 - you'll need to install at least Keras and h5py.

Start in playThrowingCards to give it a whirl. So far, the program manages to outperform me at choosing cards to throw to the crib. It also knows how to compare options during the pegging phase, though this needs further refinement.
